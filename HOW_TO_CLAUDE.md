# How to Use LLM Council with Claude Desktop

This guide summarizes the exact steps to fire up your LLM Council and connect it to Claude Desktop for high-quality, multi-model deliberation.

## 1. Start the MCP Server
Because Claude Desktop needs a live connection to your project, you must ensure the project is ready to be called. Open a terminal and run the following command first to check for any errors:

```powershell
C:\Users\carte\.local\bin\uv.exe --directory "c:\git_projects\llm-council" run llm-council
```
*(If it starts without errors, you are good to go!)*

## 2. Connect Claude Desktop
Once Claude Desktop is running, you need to ensure it "sees" your local council.
1. Open a **fresh chat** in Claude Desktop.
2. Type exactly this command:
   > `/mcp`
3. Verify that **`llm-council`** appears in the list of active servers.
4. (Optional) Click the **🔌 plug icon** in the bottom-right of the chat box to confirm it is connected.

## 3. Ask the Council
Now you can simply talk to Claude and ask him to use the council.

### Example Queries:
* **Classic Query**: *"Ask the LLM Council about [Your Question]."*
* **Deep Details**: *"Consult the Council about [Your Question] and **show me the Stage 1 details and thinking**."*
* **Dissenting Opinions**: *"Ask the Council about [Hard Problem] and **include any dissenting opinions** from the peer review stage."*

## 4. Key Configuration
* **Project Location**: `c:\git_projects\llm-council`
* **Models Used**: Open your `llm_council.yaml` to customize which models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Meta) participate in each tier.
* **API Key**: Managed securely via the Windows Credential Manager.

*Note: If the Council doesn't appear after a code change, remember to **fully quit** Claude Desktop from the System Tray and relaunch it.*
